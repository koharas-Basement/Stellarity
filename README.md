**Stellarity** *(formerly known as `FokaStudio's Ender Expansion`)* is a Minecraft 1.20 datapack which focuses on rehauling The End dimension in a new, unique and a fairly lively way, following a distinct lore built around the idea of the Illagers discovering The End long before the player.

## Description
Stellarity started off as a direct port of the [Far End](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/far-end-ender-expansion-datapack-v0-1/) datapack in December of 2021, for a server known back then as Azalea Network. As time passed, it eventually grew into its own independent project.

## Features

### Biomes
A total of **14 new biomes** has been added into the game, on top of **rehauling 4 vanilla ones**. Each biome is uniquely designed and separated into 2 categories - being either lively and welcoming or dead and barren.

Traverse they mesmerizing Amethyst Forest, with its dazzling crystals! Or climb the tall hills of End Barrens *(spoiler alert: falling from them isn't forgiving)*. Notice the very obvious reference that is The Hallow. *Or wonder about the reason behind Flesh Tundra's name...*

The island shape is also nothing like in vanilla, being of varying height, shapes and thickness. No more ugly isles on one and the same Y level.

### Items
After defeating the Ender Dragon, you unlock the access to 3 new armor sets - one focusing on defense, one focusing on offence and one focusing on mobility.

There are also countless new weapons for you to add to your arsenal. Unleash the devastating punches of the Dragonblade, direct the decaying energy of Tamaris, grown stronger with each kill using Frigid Harvester, teleport around with a pair of Spirit Daggers... There is a lot to discover on your adventures, a total of over 20 new items!

### Mobs
The End is no longer the home of only Endermen and Shulkers. Each biome is filled with a different selection of strong and dangerous foes.

If you are up for a challenge, you can summon the Empress of Light - a brand new boss *(and a pretty obvious reference, again)*. Not challenging enough? She gets additional attacks if fought in the light of day, and gets new drops too!

The Ender Dragon is also a bit tougher now, having 300 health and a few additional armor points. The amount of End Crystals is now displayed under the bossbar for quality of life.

### Structures
An ender expansion without reworked End Cities is... well, okay, it is still an ender expansion. But Stellarity does indeed redo End Cities! Built in a new style, filled with new loot and dangers!

Strongholds have also been revamped! Now they are about **7x larger**, and are filled with Illagers. They are not going to just give up the Portal, so you better come there prepared!

Some new structures have been added as well, which generate all across The End - find old Illager Campsites, set up ages ago, or settlements of Villagers in the middle of nowhere. *How did they even get there...?*

### And More!
Reel out a fish from the void, save yourself from losing all stuff with a Totem of Undying, transmute items in the hallowed waters... This simple description isn't enough to explain all the changes!

## Notes
- There is an optional resource pack for Stellarity. It isn't required at all, but it allows all new items to have custom textures!
- Stellarity is incompatible with [Nullscape](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nullscape). Other End mods were **untested**.
- Adding it to an already existing world requires you to reset The End. *(or just use a new world)*

### Multiplayer Installation (SERVER OWNERS PLEASE READ!)
> Note: this section applies **only to Spigot/Paper servers**.

After dropping the datapack into `world/datapacks` folder, delete `world_the_end` *(if present)* and turn on your server.

There is a bug where Altar of The Accursed *(very important crafting station)* doesn't load correctly. You can do `/function cmd:stellarity/generate_end_island_features` to generate it manually. This is a very peculiar bug which I was unable to fix as of right now *(it occurs only on Spigot-based servers)*.

If the vanilla portal generates overlapping the Stellarity's one, turn off your server and delete **only `DIM1` folder found inside `world_the_end`**, then turn it back on. After it is finished, run the command from earlier to generate missing End Island features.
