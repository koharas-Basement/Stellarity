**The Hallow** is an exceptionally rare [biome](index.md) found in The End. It is themed around light and magic, seen by having lots of lights and quite a lot of colors compared to other less vibrant biomes of The End.

It is based on [The Hallow](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Hallow "'The Hallow' on Terraria wiki") biome from [Terraria](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Terraria ).

## Description
Hallow is densely packed with vegetation, with domination of tall rainbow trees. The only mobs that spawn here are the [Allays](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Allay) and passive [Pixies](../mobs/pixie.md), making it one of the safest biomes in the entire pack. End Stone is replaced with Diorite and Calcite, and large Amethyst Crystals are growing from beneath the cliffs. 

Grass found here is blue, and Water has a magenta tint.

The biome tends to generate on hilly, continental terrain, although it rarely generates on forms of terrain that are a bit more shattered.

It is one of a few biomes where [End Villages](../structures/end_village.md) can be found. Apart from that, [End Cities](../structures/end_city.md) generate here as well, with Chests in the Ships having a small chance to contain <i class="icon-stellarity icon-stellarity-duskberry"></i>[Dusbkerries](../items/trinkets/duskberry.md).

## Music
Apart from regular End music, these tracks play when the player is in The Hallow specifically.
