**Stellarity** (previously known as `FokaStudio's Ender Expansion`) is a datapack which completely rehauls The End in a... unique way to say the least. Most notably - making the dimension not dead and barren, as well as creating some deeper lore for it. *Like we needed more lore for a block game.*

Stellarity has started as a direct port of [Far End](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/far-end-ender-expansion-datapack-v0-1/). The original creator - Hex - stated they do not have enough time to update the pack, so I have asked if I could do it for a server I used to be a datapack developer on.

*As you can guess, Hex said 'Yea, whatever, do what you wish'. And the first Stellarity version was an absolute attrocity...*

**And here we are today**, 5 major updates of the pack later! It is now <u>NOTHING</u> like its older brother Far End, not even one file was left as it used to be!

*And yeah, the pack is so large now that I actually had to setup a wiki.*
