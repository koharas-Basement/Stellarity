## Obtaining
Ancient Wooden Sword can be obtained by exhuming <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-wooden-sword"></i>Wooden Sword at an [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md). Result item will keep all enchantments of exhumed weapon.

## Usage
Ancient Wooden Sword has infinite Attack Speed attribute, meaning that it can be spam clicked in order to attack. Additionally, every swing will result in a sweep attack.

Altough it has quite potent attack speed, its damage of only 4:heart::heart: means it isn't as powerful as other items.

## Tips
- There are no tips, as this item is unobtainable.
    - Go use other items.

## Trivia
- The texture used for this weapon is its original pre-1.14 Programmer Art texture.
- The tooltip is kohara laughing at everyone who prefers 1.8 combat, <u>but can't justify why 1.9 one is bad with an argument other than `attack cooldowns`</u>.
- During Indev-1.6a, its flavor text used to be `what do you mean I can't spam click???`
- This is one of the 3 unbreakable items in Stellarity, other 2 being [Kaleidoscope](kaleidoscope.md) and the [Dragonblade](kaleidoscope.md).
- Before 2.0a, it used to be craftable by throwing a Wooden Sword onto the [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md).
