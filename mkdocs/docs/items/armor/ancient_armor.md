## Obtaining
Pieces of Ancient Armor have a 33% chance to generate in any Chest found inside [End Cities](../../structures/end_city.md), except for the ones on Ships. It has an additional 36% chance to have random enchantments.

Each piece of Ancient Armor can also be crafted at the [Altar of The Accursed](../../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md), using 4/8/7/5 [Ancient Plating](../materials/ancient_plating.md).


## Set Bonus
While wearing a full set of Ancient Armor, players gain the ability to increase damage on consecutive attacks. Hitting an enemy increases the damage of the next attack by 5%. This stacks up to 5 times for a grand total of 25% extra damage. This boost lasts for 5 seconds before vanishing, unless another attack has hit a mob.

The set bonus extra damage stacks with the 10% extra damage from all armor pieces, meaning the actual damage increase is 35%.

The amount of damage stacks a player has is indicated by differently pitched hit sounds, with higher pitch being equal to higher damage multiplier.

Additionally, running with a full set of Ancient Armor will produce a purely cosmetic purple trail.

## Tips
- This armor set pairs extremely well with really any weapon. The increased attack speed on top of extraordinary damage boosts is enough to make even a Wooden Sword an extremely deadly weapon.
- The damage and attack speed bonuses stack with the ones of the [Duskberry](../trinkets/duskberry.md), which makes for a destructive build.

## Trivia
- <i class="icon-stellarity icon-stellarity-ancient-armor"></i>Ancient Armor, <i class="icon-stellarity icon-stellarity-hallowed-armor"></i>[Hallowed Armor](hallowed_armor.md) and <i class="icon-stellarity icon-stellarity-living-flesh"></i>[Living Flesh](../trinkets/living_flesh.md) were the first items to have ever been added into Stellarity.
    - The first ever items to be added are [Treasure Heads](../../mechanics/treasure_heads.md)
    - While it got added as far back as v1.3a, <i class="icon-stellarity icon-stellarity-living-flesh"></i>Living Flesh had no use before v1.5a.
        - It was officialy removed as of vIndev-1.6a.
- Prior to v1.5a, this armor set was known as <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-diamond-chestplate"></i>`Ancient Diamond Armor`.
    - It also used to have random stats. It could provide a random amount of Defense, Attack Speed, Attack Knockback and Movement Speed.
        - Due to how Attack Knockback works in Minecraft, it didn't increase anything.
        - Movement Speed increase was so huge that players could trigger vanilla anti-cheat in Singleplayer while wearing 2 or more armor pieces.
- Prior to v2.0a:
	1. It used to have a different set bonus, which was just a flat 50% damage increase.
	2. Ancient Leggings used to have Diamond Leggings as base item instead of Leather Pants.
- Ancient Armor's set bonus is based on Nyx[^1] kit from Roblox BedWars[^2].
- kohara has a special particle trail, being made of Cherry Leaves particles instead of
