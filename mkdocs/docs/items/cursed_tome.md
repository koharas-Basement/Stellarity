## Obtaining
Cursed Enchiridion can be crafted at the [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed) by throwing **any** <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-enchanted-book"></i>Enchanted Book on top of it.

## Usage
Cursed Enchiridion acts in a similair way to <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-written-book"></i>Written Books, being able to be opened and read.

Initially, all pages in Cursed Enchiridion are empty. The book slowly fills its pages as players explore and progress. Entries are unlocked per-player, meaning that even if one player with a full book was to give another player who is new to the world a Cursed Enchiridion, player 2 would see every page as empty.

## Tips
- If you don't want to visit this wiki as often, definitely craft the Cursed Enchiridion.
- You will get a message in your actionbar once something is unlocked, but only if you have a Cursed Enchiridion anywhere in your inventory! If you are starting out, it is a good idea to carry it everywhere with you.
- If in Multiplayer, don't try to give other players a full Enchiridion, as they are going to receive one with their unlocked pages.

## Trivia
- The `Author` field in the tooltip actually says `kohara_`, but it is written in Illageralt font, meaning it can't be easily read.
- Despite being renamed to from `Tome` to `Enchiridion` in v2.1a, the item is still internally refered to with the id `cursed_tome`.
- kohara sometimes referes to this item as `Cursed Enchillada`.
