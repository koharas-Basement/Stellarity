## Obtaining
Cursed Tome can be crafted at the [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed) by throwing **any** <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-enchanted-book"></i>Enchanted Book on top of it.

## Usage
Cursed Tome acts in a similair way to <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-written-book"></i>Written Books, being able to be opened and read.

Initially, all pages in Cursed Tome are empty. The book slowly fills its pages as players explore and progress. Entries are unlocked per-player, meaning that even if one player with a full book was to give another player who is new to the world a Cursed Tome, player 2 would see every page as empty.

## Tips
- If you don't want to visit this wiki as often, definitely craft the Cursed Tome.

## Trivia
- The `Author` field in the tooltip actually says `kohara_`, but it is written in Illageralt font.
