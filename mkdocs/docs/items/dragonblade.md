# Dragonblade

<div class="result kohara-infobox-grid" markdown>
<div markdown class="kohara-infobox-text">
The **Dragonblade** is a post-Dragon greatsword with the ability to trigger a powerful punch after hitting a mob 3 times. Punches deal heavy damage which ignores a substantial amount of enemy defense.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-enchanted-book"></i> The Dragonblade can be enchanted with any Sword enchantment. Knockback enchantment further empowers its punch ability.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-anvil"></i> The Dragoblade is unbreakable and cannot be repaired with an Anvil. However, <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-enchanted-book"></i>Enchanted Books can be fused with the Dragonblade to transfer enchantments.

## Obtaining
After defeating the Ender Dragon for the first time, the Dragonblade spawns stuck in the [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed). It can be picked up by anyone with right-click.

Only one Dragonblade generates on each world, making it the rarest item in the entire datapack.

## Usage
Attacking enemies inflicts Dragon Stacks. After inflicting 3 Stacks are inflicted, player can sneak while holding the Dragonblade to perform a powerful punch. Stacks are reset after 16 seconds have passed or after a punch is triggered.

Punching warps affected entity 6.6 blocks away from the player. Mobs can't be warped through blocks, stopping in front of them instead. Punch deals 7:heart: х ₃.₅ of base damage. Punches have 70% armor penetration, meaning that a huge portion of the damage completely ignores enemy armor.

Punched enemies will also have Weakness I applied to them for 7 seconds, on top of being stunned for 1 second. Stunned mobs are unable to move, but it doesn't prevent them form jumping or attacking with ranged weapons. Additionaly, punched mob will be cursed with [Voided I](../mechanics/status_effects#voided) for the next 6 seconds.

If an enemy is punched into blocks, the damage is boosted to 24:heart: x ₁₂. The duration of Weakness is also increased to 11 seconds and punched mobs are stunned for 2 seconds. Enemies nearby punched mob take 4:heart::heart: splash damage, while also being afflicted with Weakness I for 3 seconds.

Each level of **Knockback enchantment** enchances punch distance by 1.1 blocks while also increasing the punch damage. The increase per level is +1.5, +4 and +1.5 for normal punch, wall punch and splash damage respectively.

Punched mobs cannot have stacks applied to them for the next 8 seconds, indicated by a cloud of dust above their head.

Punches receive only 40% of melee damage bonuses. Strength Potions do not increase punch damage, only boosting base weapon damage instead. 

The Dragonblade is unbreakable on top of being immune to lava, fire, explosions and cacti. Additionaly, it automatically returns to the Altar of The Accursed if dropped away from it, meaning that it is truly indestructible.

## Tips
- Dragonblade is extremely slow compared to other weapons, meaning that accuracy is of high importance.
- Only direct melee hits are the only option for using it as efficiently as possible.
	- Due to how Dragonblade works, enchanting it with Sweeping Edge allows it to apply Stacks to multiple enemies at once with the sweep attack.
- Knockback II <i class="icon-stellarity icon-stellarity-dragonblade"></i>Dragonblade deals 32:heart: х ₁₆ damage on punches into blocks. Do keep in mind that 60% of that damage ignores armor completely, meaning that mobs with unenchanted Netherite Armor and 20 health or less can die in a single punch.
- As the Dragonblade is unbreakable, enchanting it with Unbreaking or Mending is redundant. Don't bother wasting your Enchanted Books.

## Trivia
- The methods of obtaining the Dragonblade differed greatly throughout its development.
	- Upon its release in 1.5a, it was found stuck in the Altar of The Accursed, right after entering The End.
	- During the development of Indev-1.6a, it dropped from the Ender Dragon with a 50% chance.
		- However due to a community poll, it returned to its one-per-world state, with the only difference being it spawning after defeating the Dragon for the first time, and not prior.
- Upon release, the `/loot give` command for the Draognblade would return a broken item which couldn't be used.
	- This was patched in v1.5b.
- The Dragonblade and its ability is based on the Kaliyah[^1] kit from Roblox BedWars[^2].
	- Its description is also a reference to Kaliyahkit description - `A fearsome warrior with a fiery punch!`.
	- The quoted line is a reference to Terraria's S.D.M.G.[^3] tooltip, `It came from the edge of space`.
- Prior to Indev-1.6a, it acted as an indirect upgrade to a Netherite Sword, with its special mechanic being spawning clouds of Dragon's Breath on hits and increasing damage temporarily after that.
- During the development of vIndev-1.6a, it went through a total of 3 reworks.
	- First one was simply editing the Dragon's Breath cloud properties and damage increase.
	- Second one was similair to current behavior, but the punch damage was always 22 and it had additional upward motion. It also always triggered on the 4th hit, rather than with sneaking.
	- Third one is the current version.
- Dying to a Dragonblade's punch in PvP will result in one of a few custom death messages:
    1. `VICTIM was punched into the otherworld by PLAYER`.
    2. `VICTIM was punched a bit too hard by PLAYER`.
    3. `VICTIM was warped into another reality by PLAYER`.
- The Dragonblade is one of the 4 unbreakable items in Stellarity, the other 3 being [Ancient Wooden Sword](ancient_wooden_sword.md), maxed out [Frigid Harvester](frigid_harvester.md) and [Kaleidoscope](kaleidoscope.md).
- The sound made when the Dragonblade is dropped is the sound made when the Obsidian Claymore[^4] drops in Minecraft: Dungeons.
