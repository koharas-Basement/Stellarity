# Dragonblade

<div class="result kohara-infobox-grid" markdown>
<div markdown class="kohara-infobox-text">
**Dragonblade** is a post-Dragon greatsword with the ability to trigger a powerful punch after hitting a mob 3 times. Punches deal heavy damage which ignores a substantial amount of enemy defense.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-enchanted-book"></i> Dragonblade can be enchanted with any Sword enchantment. Knockback enchantment further empowers its punch ability.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-anvil"></i> Dragonblade is unbreakable and cannot be repaired with an Anvil. However, <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-netherite-sword"></i>Netherite Swords can be combined with Dragonblade to transfer enchantments.

## Obtaining
After defeating the Ender Dragon for the first time, the Dragonblade will spawn stuck in the [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed). It can be picked up by anyone with right-click.

Only one Dragonblade generates on each world, making it the rarest item in the entire datapack.

## Usage
Hitting enemies inflicts *'Dragon Stacks'*. The amount of Stacks an enemy has at the given moment is represented by a purple sphere above their head - brighter color is equal to more stacks. After hitting a mob 3 times, a player can sneak to trigger a powerful punch. Stacks are reset after 16 seconds have passed without either a punch or another attack.

Punching warps affected entity by 6.6 blocks away from the player. Mobs can't be warped through blocks, stopping in front of them instead. Punch deals 7:heart: х ₃.₅ of base damage. This damage ignores 60% of enemy armor, meaning that higher defense and enchantments will not reduce the damage as much as they would regularly do.

Punched enemies will also have Weakness I applied to them for 7 seconds, on top of being stunned for 1 second. Stuns make mobs completely unable to move. Immobilization doesn't prevent jumping and fall damage.

If an enemy is punched into blocks, the damage is boosted to 24:heart: x ₁₂. The duration of Weakness is boosted to 11 seconds and punched mobs are stunned for 2 seconds. Other enemies will take 4:heart::heart: splash damage, while also being afflicted with Weakness I for 3 seconds.

Each level of **Knockback enchantment** enchances punch distance by 1.1 blocks while also increasing the damage. The increase per level is +1.5, +4 and +1.5 for regular, wall and splash type damage respectively.

Punched mobs cannot have stacks applied to them for the next 8 seconds, indicated by a cloud of dust above their head.

Punches deal explosion damage, meaning that **Blast Protection enchantment** is going to be more efficient at blocking it.

## Tips
- Dragonblade is extremely slow compared to other weapons, meaning that accuracy is of high importance.
- Only direct melee hits are the only option for using it as efficiently as possible.
    - Due to how Dragonblade works, enchanting it with Sweeping Edge allows it to apply Stacks to multiple enemies at once with the sweep attack.
- Knockback II <i class="icon-stellarity icon-stellarity-dragonblade"></i>Dragonblade deals 32:heart: х ₁₆ damage on punches into blocks. Do keep in mind that 60% of that damage ignores armor completely.
- As Dragonblade is unbreakable, enchanting it with Unbreaking or Mending is redundant. Don't bother wasting your Enchanted Books.
- Punch damage cannot be increased by any bonuses, e.g. Strength Potions.
- In PvP, it might be a good idea to use a Blast Protection armor set if going against someone with the Dragonblade as even with Knockback II wall punch, the enchantment can reduce the damage to almost nothing.

## Trivia
- The methods of obtaining the Dragonblade differed greatly throughout its development.
    - Upon its release in 1.5a, it was found stuck in the Altar of The Accursed, right after entering The End.
        - During the development of Indev-1.6a, it dropped from the Ender Dragon with a 50% chance.
            - However due to a community poll, it returned to its one-per-world state, with the only difference being it spawning after defeating the Dragon for the first time, and not prior.
    - Dragonblade can also be obtained with commands, but upon release they would return a broken item instead, meaning that it was truly one-per world.
        - This was patched in 1.5b, with its `/loot give` command functioning as intended.
- This item and its ability is based on Kaliyah[^1] kit from Roblox BedWars[^2].
    - Its description is also a reference to Kaliyahkit description - `A fearsome warrior with a fiery punch!`.
    - The quoted line is a reference to Terraria's S.D.M.G.[^3] tooltip, `It came from the edge of space`.
- Prior to Indev-1.6a, it acted as an indirect upgrade to a Netherite Sword, with its special mechanic being spawning clouds of Dragon's Breath on hits and increasing damage temporarily after that.
- During the development of 2.0a, it went through a total of 3 reworks.
    - First one was simply editing the Dragon's Breath cloud properties and damage increase.
    - Second one was similair to current behavior, but the punch damage was always 22 and it had additional upward motion. It also always triggered on the 4th hit, rather than with sneaking.
    - Third one is the one currently used in the pack.
- Dying to a Dragonblade's punch in PvP will result in a custom death message - `VICTIM was punched into the otherworld by PLAYER`.
- The Dragonblade is one of the 3 unbreakable items in Stellarity, the other 2 being [Ancient Wooden Sword](ancient_wooden_sword.md) and [Kaleidoscope](kaleidoscope.md).
