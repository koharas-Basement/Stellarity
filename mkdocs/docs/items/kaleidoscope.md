## Obtaining
Kaleidoscope is a guaranteed drop from the [Empress of Light](../mobs/bosses/empress_of_light.md), but only if she is killed in the Overworld during the day. This makes obtaining it extremely challenging.

## Usage
Holding Kaleidoscope in main hand causes it to rapidly charge up. Current charge is displayed in player's action bar.

Attacking a mob resets the charge back to 0. If charge is under 33, nothing happens. However, if player's charge is above that amount, a powerful discharge is going to happen which deals extra damage with some splash damage as well.

The discharge damage stacks with weapons's base damage of 7.

| Charge | Damage | Splash radius | Armor penetration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 33 | 2 + `charge`/10 | :x: | 20% |
| 66 | 6 + `charge`/10 | 2.4 | 20% |
| 100 | 23 | 4.2 | 20% |

Discharge damage is reduced further by Blast Protection enchantment. This does not affect base sword damage.

## Tips
- Enchantments like Sharpness, Smite or Bane of Arthropods only increase Kaleidoscope's base damage. Discharge damage can't be increased by any means.
- Since it is unbreakable, enchanting it with Mending and/or Unbreaking is pointless.

## Trivia
- Dying to a Kaleidoscope's discharge in PvP will result in a custom death message - `VICTIM couldn't stand PLAYER's heat`.
    - This is... quite an obvious joke right there.
- The sounds used to indicate max charge and the ones used for discharges come from the Dynamo enchantment from Minecraft: Dungeons.
- Kaleidoscope is one of the 3 unbreakable items in Stellarity, the other 2 being the [Dragonblade](dragonblade.md) and [Ancient Wooden Sword](ancient_wooden_sword.md).
