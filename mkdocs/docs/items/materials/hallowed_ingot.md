## Obtaining
Hallowed Ingots can be found inside any Crate fished up via [Void Fishing](../../mechanics/void_fishing.md) or Chests in Dungeons and End Cities.

Armorers, Weaponsmiths and Toolsmiths in [End Villages](../../structures/end_village.md) have a chance to sell 4 Hallowed Ingots for 12 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-emerald"></i>Emeralds.

Alternatively, an Iron Block can be [consecrated](../../mechanics/consecration.md) into 2 Hallowed Ingots.

## Usage
Combining 5, 8, 7 or 4 Hallowed Ingots over the [Altar of The Accursed](../../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md) crafts a piece of Hallowed Armor.

## Trivia
- Before the addition of Hallowed Ingots, Hallowed Armor used to be found directly inside Crates.
