## Obtaining
Pixies drop 0 - 4 Pixie Dust when killed. Pixie Dust can also be found in End Ships in place of Glowstone Dust, but only if they generate in The Hallow.

## Usage
Pixie Dust can be used at the [Altar of The Accursed](../../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md) to craft <i class="icon-stellarity icon-stellarity-sariel"></i>[Sariel](../sariel.md), or in regular crafting recipes in place of <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-glowstone-dust"></i>Glowstone Dust.

It can also be offered as a sacrifice at the Chapel of Light, which summons the Empress of Light boss.

## Trivia
- The flavor text `May contain Fairy` is a play on how the material itself actually comes from fairies.
