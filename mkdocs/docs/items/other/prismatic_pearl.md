**Prismatic Pearl** is a post-Empress item which acts like an infinite supply of Ender Pearls. As an added bonus, it also flies faster and further compared to a regular Ender Pearl.

## Obtaining
Prismatic Pearl has a 33% chance to be dropped by the Empress of Light, but only if killed in The End or in the Overworld during nighttime.

## Usage
Prismatic Pearl works just the same way an Ender Pearl works, however after being thrown, it returns to the player after 5 seconds.

On top of that, it flies 25% faster, which translates into 25% greater teleport distance.

Prismatic Pearl leaves a rainbow trail as it flies.

## Tips 
- There is no minimum damage treshold required for stars to spawn.
    - This means that Starstruck Carcanet synergizes well with Shulker Armor due to provided tankiness and damage resistance.

## Trivia
- Players named `Bush_King` have an alternative pearl trail. Instead of a rainbow, it alternates between the colors of a bisexual flag.
- This item was made just so Bush would shut up.
    - Spoiler alert: it didn't work :pensive:.
