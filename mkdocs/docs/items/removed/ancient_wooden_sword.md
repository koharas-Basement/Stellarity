## Obtaining
Ancient Wooden Sword could be obtained by exhuming <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-wooden-sword"></i>Wooden Sword at an [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md). Result item kept all enchantments of the weapon used in the process.

## Usage
Ancient Wooden Sword has infinite Attack Speed attribute, meaning that it can be spam clicked to attack. Additionally, because of how post-1.9 combat works, every normal swing is a sweep attack.

Altough it has quite potent attack speed, its damage value of only 4:heart::heart: means it isn't as powerful as other on-tier items.

## Tips
- There are no tips, as this item is unobtainable.
    - Go use other items. You know, the ones you can actually get without cheating.

## Trivia
- The texture used for this weapon is the original pre-1.14 Programmer Art texture for a Wooden Sword...
    - ...which was also the texture it used from the very moment it got added.
- The tooltip is kohara laughing at everyone who prefers 1.8 combat, <u>but can't justify why 1.9 one is bad with an argument other than `attack cooldowns bad`</u>.
- During Indev-1.6a, its flavor text used to be `what do you mean I can't spam click???`.
- This is one of the few unbreakable items in Stellarity.
- Despite being considered 'removed' since v2.0a, it got a single change in v2.1a.
