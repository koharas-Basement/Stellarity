## Obtaining
Living Flesh could be found in [End Dungeons](../../structures/end_dungeon.md) in piles of 1 - 8.

Alternatively, [void fishing](../../mechanics/void_fishing.md) in the [Flesh Tundra](../../biomes/flesh_tundra.md) could yield 2 - 6 per catch, and there was also a 70% chance a Hematic Crate would contain 1 - 2 Living Flesh.

## Usage
After eating Living Flesh, players would heal 60:heart: x ₃₀ health over the next 3 seconds through Regeneration VII buff. However, players would also be inflicted with Weakness for 30 seconds - 15 seconds of Weakness II, fading into 15 seconds of Weakness I.
