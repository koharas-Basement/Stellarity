**Stella** is a post-Empress sword which applies Prismatic Inferno on hit. Unlike most DoT inflicting weapons, Stella can stack the damage of its flames up to 5 times and they last longer.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-enchanted-book"></i> Stella can be enchanted with any Sword enchantment.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-anvil"></i> Stella can be repaired with <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-netherite-ingot"></i>Netherite Ingots.

## Obtaining
Stella has a 33% chance to be dropped by the Empress of Light, but only if killed in The End or in the Overworld during nighttime.

## Usage
Like most other Empress drops damaging enemies sets them on Prismatic Inferno

## Tips
- This weapon is great for hitting and running. Just make sure to reapply Prismatic Inferno every few seconds for it to not timeout.

## History
=== "**v2.0c**"
	- Fixed Stella sometimes applying 2 stacks of Prismatic Inferno at once.
	- Fixed stack amount being capped at 4 rather than 5 as intended.
	- Reduced the duration of Prismatic Inferno (5s -> 4s).
	- Added sounds on attacks, improved Inferno particles based on the amount of stacks.
	- Prismatic Inferno nerf: Prismatic Inferno no longer has 30% armor penetration.

=== "**v2.0a**"
    - Introduced.
