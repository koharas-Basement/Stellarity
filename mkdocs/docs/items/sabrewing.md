## Obtaining
Sabrewing can be crafted at the [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md) by combining a regular <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-bow"></i>Bow, 10 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-feather"></i>Feathers, 12 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-gold-ingot"></i>Gold Ingots and a single <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-netherite-ingot
"></i>Netherite Bar. The enchantments from the <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-bow"></i>Bow used to craft it will be safely transferred to the outcome item.

## Usage
With Sabrewing, players can choose to supercharge their shot by drawing it for a total of 3 seconds. Supercharging will directly increase arrow velocity and damage by 60%. Arrows will also gain the ability to pierce through 1 mob to hit another one directly behind it. However, shot arrows will combust after colliding with a block, making them irrecoverable.

While charging Sabrewing, players move 25% slower compared to charging regular Bows.

## Tips
- Stay at a safe distance and try to snipe all the targets. Due to its longer draw time, it is discouraged to use it in closer range battles.
    - 60% more velocity means longer range, which further suggests sniping targets from a distance.

## Trivia
- This item is based on Sabrewing from Minecraft: Dungeons.
    - Surprisingly, its special ability isn't based on the weapon itself, but on enchantments from the game - Overcharge and Dynamo.
- Its tooltip is a reference to the fact that during some time in development it had the ability take out every mob *(even bosses)* with Power V.
    - It is also a reference to kohara's initial testing, where the item dealt about a 1000 damage per shot due to an oversight.
- This items used to function differently some time during the development of 2.0a.
    - Its draw time used to be 15 seconds, and it applied a rising damage multiplier which scaled with it. Max multiplier was 9x.
        - This was changed as even though the damage per hit was great, Sabrewing's DPS was inferior to any other end-game ranged weapon's.
