# Sariel

<div class="result kohara-infobox-grid" markdown>
<div markdown class="kohara-infobox-text">
**Sariel** is a post-Dragon dagger that can sometimes spawn healing orbs on enemy hits. Healing orbs slowly fly towards the nearest player and heal them for 4:heart::heart: HP. Healing orbs won't spawn when players are damaged in PvP.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-enchanted-book"></i> Sariel can be enchanted with any Sword enchantment.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-anvil"></i> Sariel can be repaired with <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-iron-ingot"></i>Iron Ingots.

## Obtaining
Sariel can be crafted at the [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md) by combining an <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-iron-sword"></i>Iron Sword, 5 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-gold-ingot"></i>Gold Ingots and 10 <i class="icon-stellarity icon-stellarity-pixie-dust"></i>[Pixie Dust](materials/pixie_dust.md), meaning that in order to craft it, the player has to venture into [The Hallow](../biomes/the_hallow.md) first.

## Usage
After attacking any mob, there is a 18% chance that a Healing Orb will spawn, slowly flying towards the nearest player while accelerating slighly. After coming into contact with one, player will be healed by 4:heart::heart: HP. Up to 2 Healing Orbs can be spawned at once, however only one will spawn most of the time.

| Number of Healing Orbs | Chance |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 18% |
| 2 | 3.24% |

## Tips
- Due to Sariel's low damage, it is heavily discouraged to use it as a primary weapon. It should be used as a support weapon players quickly switch to in order to heal a bit.
    - Alternatively, if on Multiplayer, one player could only use Sariel on order to heal nearby teammates in e.g. a boss fight.
- Its quick attack speed can be utilized to heal large portions of lost HP when attacking in a quick succesion.

## Trivia
- Sariel will not spawn any Healing Orbs if damage done in a single hit is lower than 3. 
    - This is in order to prevent spam clicking to heal massive amounts of HP.
    - However, its attack speed is enough to compensate for that.
        - You can enchant Sariel with Sharpness to reach the minimum damage treshold even quicker.
- Its name is a reference to [Sariel](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Sariel) - a charcater from Touhou Project game series.
    - Despite Sariel being a Death Angel in Touhouthe item itself deals very little damage and focuses on healing instead.
    - Its tooltip is a reference to [Sariel's first theme](https://youtu.be/YiN9rqnxw20), that has the exact same title.
    - Sariels are also archangels, mainly from Judaic tradition.
- Healing Orbs move  a bit slower than player's running speed, but a bit faster than their walking speed.
- Sariel has went through a total of 7 changes to its healing chance during the development of 2.0a.
    - These were as following: `18%` -> `27%` -> `22%` -> `33%` -> `20%` -> `15%` -> `12%` -> `18%`.
- During some time in its development, the Healing Orbs used to slowly gain momentum as they flew.
    - Alotugh this was changed and now they always move at set speed in.
    - This was made so that players have to stick near attacked enemy to not outspeed the Healing Orb, but kohara changed it because it felt annoying.
- Upon initial release, instead of using 5 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-gold-ingot"></i>Gold Ingots to craft it, a <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-wither-skeleton-skull"></i>Wither Skeleton Skull was used instead.
    - This was changed in order to make it cheaper to craft and require less grinding for materials.
- During development it used to have a durability value of 777, which is a number symbolizing divine guidance.
