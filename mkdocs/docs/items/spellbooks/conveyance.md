## Obtaining
Book of Conveyance has a 15% chance to be dropped by Evokers in [Strongholds](../../structures/stronghold.md). This chance is boosted by 3% for every level of Looting, for a maximum of 21%. However due to the drop being randomly chosen between Book of Conveyance, [Light](light.md) and [Updraft](updraft.md), this chance is about 1/3rd of this.

Librarians in [End Villages](../structures/end_village.md) can turn any Enchanted Book into Books of Conveyance for 64 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-emerald"></i>Emeralds.
