## Obtaining
Book of Light has a 15% chance to be dropped by Evokers in [Strongholds](../../structures/stronghold.md). This chance is boosted by 3% for every level of Looting, for a maximum of 21%. However due to the drop being randomly chosen between [Book of Conveyance](conveyance.md), Light and [Updraft](updraft.md), this chance is about 1/3rd of this.

Librarians in [End Villages](../../structures/end_village.md) can turn any Enchanted Book into Books of Light for 64 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-emerald"></i>Emeralds.

## Usage
Right-clicking creates a healing aura with a radius of 5.5 blocks. Any player who steps inside will get Regeneration II and Resistance I. They will also be cured from Weakness and Slowness debuffs.

Aura lasts for 17 seconds. There is a 48 second cooldown between creating different auras.

## Tips 
- This books is exceptionally great in Multiplayer, where multiple players can get affected by the healing aura.

## Trivia
- Even though the description says it has a 48 second cooldown, it starts right when an aura is created, meaning the actual cooldown is 31 seconds instead.
