## Obtaining
Book of Updraft has a 15% chance to be dropped by Evokers in [Strongholds](../../structures/stronghold.md). This chance is boosted by 3% for every level of Looting, for a maximum of 21%. However due to the drop being randomly chosen between [Book of Conveyance](conveyance.md), [Light](light.md) and Updraft, this chance is about 1/3rd of this.

Librarians in [End Villages](../../structures/end_village.md) can turn any Enchanted Book into Books of Updraft for 64 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-emerald"></i>Emeralds.

## Usage
Right-clicking gives its user immense vertical boost of about 22.5 blocks. Afterwards they are given the ability to glide for 7 seconds. After glide expires, Slow Falling is given until landing.

Glide can be cancelled earlier by sneaking.

This has a cooldown of 16 seconds, which starts counting **after** landing.

## Tips 
- While gliding with an Elytra, the boost is about 50% stronger, which is useful for restoring height.
    - Boost closes the Elytra, but it can be reopened right afterwads. Remember that sneaking cancels the glide early!
- Combining this book with Book of Conveyance makes up for an excellent mobility item combination.
- Due to a bug with Levitation, being damaged during the 7 second glide will result in players being boosted upwards even further.

## Trivia
- The book's name is very similair to Tome of Updraft from Minecraft: Dungeons, however instead of pushing mobs around upwards it pushes players.
