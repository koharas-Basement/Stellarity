**Spirit Dagger** is a special dagger that can attract Spirits on attacks. Consuming them instantly teleports to their location and gives attack buffs for short duration.

It is intended to be a post-Dragon item, however obtaining it before killing the Ender Dragon is possible, but extremely tedious.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-enchanted-book"></i> Spirit Dagger can be enchanted with any Sword enchantment. Certain enchantments will have new effects.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-anvil"></i> Spirit Dagger can be repaired with <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-diamond"></i>Diamonds.

## Obtaining
Spirit Dagger has a 9% chance to drop from Phantoms **found anywhere in The End**. It won't drop from them anywhere else. Looting enchantment increases the odds by 1% per level, for a maximum of 12% drop chance with Looting III.

## Usage
<div class="result" markdown>
<figure class="kohara-side-image--right" markdown>

Spirit Dagger is quite unique in terms of usage. While using only one, damaging enemies has a 50% chance to attract Spirits, but you won't be able to do anything witht hem unless you are holding 2 Spirit Daggers - one in your main hand, and one in your offhand. There can be only one Spirit in a 4 block radius.

Spirits can be consumed by focusing on them for 7 ticks while holding 2 Daggers. Consumption progress will be shown in the action bar.

Consuming Spirits instantly teleports player to their location. Teleportation will create a large area of effect attack which damages all enemies around arrival location for 4:heart::heart: damage with 100% armor penetration. Afterwards player receives a small combat buff -  4:yellow_heart::yellow_heart: points of Absorption, +2:heart: damage and +30% movement speed. Buffs last for 5 seconds.

Attacked mobs that __have attracted a Spirit__ won't be able to do it again for 17 seconds, indicated by a spray of particles above their head.

### Enchantments

As previously mentioned, certain enchantments are going to empower Spirit Dagger in an additional way compared to their usual behavior.

| Enchantment | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| Sweeping Edge | Increases slash attack damage by 0.5/level. |
| Fire Aspect | Slash attack sets mobs on fire for 1.5s/level. Does not work on players in PvP. |
| Knockback | Adds knockback to the slash attack. Does not work on players in PvP. |
| Bane of Arthropods | Arthropod type mobs will have Slowness IV inflicted to them for `1` to `(1.5 + [level * 0.5])` seconds. |

Enchantment power scales with both Daggers, meaning that having Sweeping Edge III on one of them and Sweeping Edge II on the other one will act as Sweeping Edge V.

## Tips
- Spirits can be attracted by ANY damage, including *(but not limited to)* other Swords, Crossbows, Bows, etc., for as long as you are holding a Spirit Dagger in any hand.
    - However, the damage dealt has to be higher than 3:heart: х ₁.₅. Anything lower will simply not work.
- Teleporting has a distance limit of <u><b>70 blocks</b></u>, meaning that you could potentialy attract a Spirit by shooting an enemy with a Bow and teleport a great range.
    - Spyglass comes in handy in this scenario, since you can easily position your cursor on a Spirit and then switch to a Spirit Dagger in order to consume it.
- To fully use this weapon you have to obtain 2 of them. Using a weapon enchanted with Looting III is heavily encouraged due to how uncommon Phantoms are in The End.
    - Despite the drop chance being relatively low, this item can be easily obtained in great quantities by opening multiple [Pandora's Barrels](other/pandoras_barrel.md). Be careful though, as Pandora's Barrel also increases stats of spawned mobs.
- Slash attack won't deal any knockback, so you might still get damaged by mobs after teleporting.
    - Luckily, the 4:yellow_heart::yellow_heart: Absorption should be enough to tank at least part of the contact damage.
    - This can be remedied by enchanting your Spirit Daggers with Knockback.
- This item pairs extremely well with [Sharanga](sharanga.md), since Arrows shot from are unaffected by gravity, meaning that it is easier to snipe targets from far away in order to potentially attract Spirits.

## Trivia
- This is the second Developer weapon to get added into Stellarity, the first being [Prismatic Punch](prismatic_punch.md).
- This weapon is based on Spirit Daggers - a weapon used by Evelynn[^1] in Roblox BedWars[^2].
    - This is also a reference to the fact that kohara loves this game and plays it far more often than he is coding.
- This item had a total of 3 different drop chances prior to official release.
    - It first started with 12.5% base chance with 2.5% Looting bonus, then 15%/+3.5% before being nerfed to 10%/+1%, which stayed to this date.
- Prior to official release of 2.0a, Spirits used to directly heal 4:heart::heart: HP instead of granting 4:yellow_heart::yellow_heart: Absorption like it does now. This change was made to further replicate how Evelynn kit works in Roblox Bedwars.
- Spirit Dagger holds the title of the most tweaked weapon before its official release in a stable version, having been tweaked countless times prior to its release in 2.0a.
    - Some of the changes haven't even been listed on changelog Discord channel.
- In a development log made on January 27th 2023, Spirits were said have a light blue glowing outline, however this wasn't actually implemented.
- In PvP, dying to AoE slash attack will result in a custom death message - `VICTIM had their spirit consumed by PLAYER`.
