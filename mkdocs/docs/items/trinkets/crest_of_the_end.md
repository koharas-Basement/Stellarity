## Obtaining
Crest of The End has a 50% chance to be dropped by the Ender Dragon. It always drops with either a [Tamaris](../tamaris.md) or an [Ender Insignia](ender_insignia.md).

## Usage
Blocking damage with Crest of The End stores a part of blocked damage, adding +15% multiplier to player's next attack. This stacks up to 3 times for up to +45% extra damage for their next melee hit. This boost is reset after a hit is landed or after 2.5 seconds have passed.

Blocking an axe attack releases a large AoE explosion which doesn't destroy blocks, but deals 14 damage to anything in a 4 block radius. This explosion also applies [Jinx](../../mechanics/status_effects.md#jinx) for 8 seconds to hurt mobs, which temporarily reduces armor and armor toughness. Blocking an axe attack also instantly adds a 3 stack damage multiplier (+45%) to player's next attack.

Crest of The End, similairly to Netherite items, is immune to fire and lava, being unable to be destroyed by them.

## Tips
- Crest of The End is a retalation-focused Shield. Tanking a few hits and then striking back is not only its intended purpose, but also a really efficient way to deal huge damage.
- The Jinx explosion and Jinx effect are fantastic counters to axe combat.
    - Especially the Jinx effect, as it will leave your opponents vulnerable for the extra powerful attack in retalation.

## Trivia
- Crest of The End acts as an indirect upgrade to a regular Shield.
- During its development it used to give players the ability to dash, but it was confusing and hard to use so it was changed.
    - This was ability was later reworked and added as [Copper Elektra Shield](copper_elektra_shield.md).
