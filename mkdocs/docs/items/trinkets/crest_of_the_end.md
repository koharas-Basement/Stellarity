## Obtaining
Crest of The End has a 66% chance to be dropped by the Ender Dragon. It always drops with either a [Tamaris](../tamaris.md) or an [Ender Insignia](ender_insignia.md).

## Usage
Blocking damage with Crest of The End stores a part of blocked damage, adding +1:heart: x 0.5 damage to player's next melee attack. This effect is capped at +8:heart::heart::heart::heart: damage. After attacking this bonus resets and it can gather strength again.

## Tips
- Crest of The End is an indirect upgrade to a regular Shield. There is no point in choosing a regular over it, so keep that in mind.

## Trivia
- During some point in its development, it used to give players the ability to dash, but it was confusing and hard to use so it was changed.
