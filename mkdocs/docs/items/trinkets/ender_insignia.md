## Obtaining
Ender Insignia has a 66% chance to be dropped by the Ender Dragon. It always drops with either a [Tamaris](../tamaris.md) or a [Crest of The End](crest_of_the_end.md).

## Usage
Sneaking while holding the Ender Insignia in any hand accelerates life regeneration by applying Regeneration I. The amplifier of the aformentioned potion effect is increased by 1 every 2 seconds. This caps at Regeneration IV.

Standing up or being hurt resets the Regeneration and applies a very short half a second cooldown before Ender Insignia starts working again.

Movement speed is reduced by additional 66% while sneaking, meaning that moving around is going to be incredibly slow.

### Regeneration Bonuses

> This section is transcribed from Minecraft Wiki

| Regeneration Level | Ticks per :heart: | :heart: per second |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 100 | 0.4 (:heart: x ₀․₂) |
| 2 | 50 | 0.4 (:heart: x ₀․₄) |
| 3 | 24 | 1.67 (:heart: x ₀․₈₃₅) |
| 4 | 12 | 3.33 (:heart: x ₁․₆₆₅) |
| 5 | 6 | 6.67 (:heart: x ₃․₃₃₅) |

## Tips
- Swift Sneak Enchantment pairs well with this item, since you can get a bit more mobility while keeping its regeneration bonus.
- You can quickly switch to holding Ender Insignia whenever you need to quickly regenerate some Health.

## Trivia

- Prior to 2.0a:
	1. Ender Insignia used to give a set Regeneration bonus.
	2. Due to the way Regeneration was implemented, it would be constantly reapplied, slowing down health gain or even preventing it in some scenarios.
	3. Ender Insignia used to trigger while standing still rather than sneaking, but this was changed due to performance reasons.

## History
=== "**v2.0a**"
    - No longer stackable.
    - Max regeneration level reduced by 1 (V -> IV).
    - Increased time between Regeneration upgrades (1.5s -> 2.5s).

=== "**vIndev-1.6a**"
	- Drop rate reduced in favor of other items (100% -> 66%).
	- Regeneration is no longer instantly at Level V, and it instead progressively goes through different amplifierss.
	- Being hit now properly cancels Regeneration.
	- Regeneration now gets applied while sneaking, rather than standing still.
	- Fixed a bug that caused Regeneration to not work at all sometimes.

=== "**v1.5b**"
    - Fixed a bug that caused Ender Insignia's give command to return a broken item instead.

=== "**v1.5a**"
	- Introduced.
