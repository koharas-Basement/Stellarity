## Obtaining
When killed during the night or in The End, [Empress of Light](../../mobs/bosses/empress_of_light.md) has a 20% chance to drop the Soaring Insignia.

Soaring Insignia is also **guaranteed** to drop if she is killed in the Overworld during the day.

## Usage
While holding it in any hand, player gets the ability to fly, similair to creative flight. They can start flying by sneaking and looking slightly upwards. From then, sneaking and looking up or down will either make them slowly ascend or descend. Releasing sneak button will make them hover on a constant height.

Coming into contact with ground, any liquid or swapping items immedietaly stops flight.

## Tips 
- Max horizontal flight speed is the same as base running speed and can't be increased.

## Trivia
- This item is based on Soaring Insignia from Terraria.
    - It even uses its texture.
