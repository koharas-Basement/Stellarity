## Obtaining
Starstruck Carcanet has a 33% chance to be dropped by the Empress of Light, but only if killed in The End or in the Overworld during nighttime.

## Usage
Taking damage summons 3 stars which fall onto random locations around player. They explode after touching the ground, dealing 4:heart::heart: damage with 50% armor penetration to all nearby mobs.

Stars ignore immunity frames, meaning that all 3 stars can properly deal damage when hitting the same enemy.

Stars will spawn on any type of damage. If spawned inside blocks, they won't collide with any until coming into contact with a non-solid block, meaning they also work in caves.

## Tips 
- There is no minimum damage treshold required for stars to spawn.
    - This means that Starstruck Carcanet synergizes well with Shulker Armor due to provided tankiness and damage resistance.

## Trivia
- This item is based on Star Cloak from Terraria.
- Despite being called a carcanet, it resembled a traditional necklace a lot more.
    - Additionaly, it isn't even worn, but held instead.
- During its development:
    - Stars used to ignore all enemy defense, but dealt only 1 damage to players in PvP.
    - Star explosion radius was increased by 60% compared to its original size.
    - Star damage was reduced (4 -> 3) and then increased (3 -> 4).
- Despite its tooltip stating that star damage ignores half of an entity's armor, rather half of the damage ignores armor completely.
