## Obtaining
Zephyr can be found in Top Tower Chests inside [End Cities](../structures/end_city.md) with a 14% chance.

## Usage
Holding Zephyr in main hand gives a passive 7.5% Movement Speed bonus.

Killing any mob with this shortsword grants Speed I for 25 seconds. Each kill, rather than refreshing simply refreshing duration, adds extra uptime on the effect, capped at 2:45 minutes. Added time falls off based on current duration of Speed added by Zephyr.

The ability speed increase stacks with passive speed increase for a total of 27.5% extra movement speed.

## Tips
- Setting up a mob farm can easily replace the need to craft Swiftness Potions.
	- Maximum duration of Zephyr's speed boost is slightly smaller than the duration of an extended Swiftness Potion.
- Passive 7.5% boost doesn't work if Zephyr is held in the offhand.
- Zephyr has almost identical stats as a Diamond Sword, with the only difference being its lower durability, being just a bit higher than the one of an Iron Sword.

## Trivia
- The word `zephyr` means a soft light breeze.
- Before its introduction, Klee's Dedicated Item used to be a Knockback V Stick.

## History

    - Base movement speed bonus reduced (10% -> 7.5%).
