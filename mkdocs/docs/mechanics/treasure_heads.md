## Obtaining
As previously mentioned, Treasure Heads have a 25% chance to generate in either **Top Tower**, **Ship** or **Common** Chests found inside End Cities. Additionally, Treasure type Chests have a *66% chance* to contain *1 - 2* different Treasure Heads, with more generating dependant on player's Luck.

Additionally, all Crates found via [Void Fishing](void_fishing.md) can sometimes yield a Treasure Head as well.

## Usage
Treasure Heads serve no purpose other than being fun collectibles.

## Trivia
- Before 2.0a, there used to be 105 Treasure Heads total, with some being borrowed from [Dungeon Now Loading](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/dungeon-now-loading-5-new-dungeons-5-new-bosses/) datapack.
- ArubikU currently has 4 Treasure Heads of theirs added into Stellarity, while the maximum number of submissions was 3.
    - This was due to kohara's oversight while counting, resulting in 4th Head being added. However, he decided not to remove it.
- Treasure Heads of TheTechnoFakerz and Zichee will always generate toghether in one Chest.
    - This was done per request of TheTechnoFakerz (Oreki) on Discord.
- Treasure Heads were first special mechanic added to Stellarity, dating back as far as version v1.1a.
    - Since their public release, they haven't been changed for almost a year, not until v2.0a and then v2.1a.
