Clockwork Crossbow can be enchanted with any Crossbow enchantment. Due to it ignoring Crossbow charging, Quick Charge has a brand new effect. Clockwork Crossbow can be repaired by fusing it with a different Crossbow.

Durability 365 Obtaining \u00b6 Clockwork Crossbow has a chance to drop from Pillagers in Strongholds with a 7% base chance. Each level of Looting increases the odds by 2%, up to a total of 13% with Looting III. Fletchers in End Villages can also turn any existing Crossbow into Clockwork Crossbow for 64 Emeralds. Usage \u00b6 Holding Clockwork Crossbow will automatically load it, provided there is at least 1 Arrow in player's inventory. Arrows will be stripped of all special properties (e.g. Spectral Arrows -> Arrows). There is a 33% chance to not consume any arrows upon loading. Quick Charge enchantment increases the odds by 7% per level, giving a maximum of 54% chance to save Arrows with Quick Charge III. Shot Arrows deal only 3 x \u2081\u2024\u2085 damage per shot and cannot be picked up once fired. Tips \u00b6 Clockwork Crossbow loads itself every 6 ticks, meaning that on average it shoots about 3.33 Arrows per second. Due to projectiles ignoring invulnerability ticks, fired Arrows will never bounce off the target dealing no damage. This effectively makes Multishot Clockwork Crossbow incredibly deadly up close, dealing triple damage.

It can be picked up by anyone with right-click. Only one Dragonblade generates on each world, making it the rarest item in the entire datapack. Usage \u00b6 Hitting enemies inflicts 'Dragon Stacks' . The amount of Stacks an enemy has at the given moment is represented by a purple sphere above their head - brighter color is equal to more stacks. After hitting a mob 3 times, a player can sneak to trigger a powerful punch. Stacks are reset after 16 seconds have passed without either a punch or another attack. Punching warps affected entity by 6.6 blocks away from the player. Mobs can't be warped through blocks, stopping in front of them instead. Punch deals 7 \u0445 \u2083.\u2085 of base damage. This damage ignores 60% of enemy armor, meaning that higher defense and enchantments will not reduce the damage as much as they would regularly do. Punched enemies will also have Weakness I applied to them for 7 seconds, on top of being stunned for 1 second. Stuns make mobs completely unable to move. Immobilization doesn't prevent jumping and fall damage. If an enemy is punched into blocks, the damage is boosted to 24 x \u2081\u2082. The duration of Weakness is boosted to 11 seconds and punched mobs are stunned for 2 seconds. Other enemies will take 4 splash damage, while also being afflicted with Weakness I for 3 seconds. Each level of Knockback enchantment enchances punch distance by 1.1 blocks while also increasing the damage. The increase per level is +1.5, +4 and +1.5 for regular, wall and splash type damage respectively. Punched mobs cannot have stacks applied to them for the next 8 seconds, indicated by a cloud of dust above their head. Punches deal explosion damage, meaning that Blast Protection enchantment is going to be more efficient at blocking it. Tips \u00b6 Dragonblade is extremely slow compared to other weapons, meaning that accuracy is of high importance. Only direct melee hits are the only option for using it as efficiently as possible. Due to how Dragonblade works, enchanting it with Sweeping Edge allows it to apply Stacks to multiple enemies at once with the sweep attack. Knockback II Dragonblade deals 32 \u0445 \u2081\u2086 damage on punches into blocks. Do keep in mind that 60% of that damage ignores armor completely. As Dragonblade is unbreakable, enchanting it with Unbreaking or Mending is redundant. Don't bother wasting your Enchanted Books. Punch damage cannot be increased by any bonuses, e.g. Strength Potions. In PvP, it might be a good idea to use a Blast Protection armor set if going against someone with the Dragonblade as even with Knockback II wall punch, the enchantment can reduce the damage to almost nothing. Trivia \u00b6 The methods of obtaining the Dragonblade differed greatly throughout its development. Upon its release in 1.5a, it was found stuck in the Altar of The Accursed, right after entering The End. During the development of Indev-1.6a, it dropped from the Ender Dragon with a 50% chance. However due to a community poll, it returned to its one-per-world state, with the only difference being it spawning after defeating the Dragon for the first time, and not prior. Dragonblade can also be obtained with commands, but upon release they would return a broken item instead, meaning that it was truly one-per world.

Prior to Indev-1.6a, it acted as an indirect upgrade to a Netherite Sword, with its special mechanic being spawning clouds of Dragon's Breath on hits and increasing damage temporarily after that. During the development of 2.0a, it went through a total of 3 reworks. First one was simply editing the Dragon's Breath cloud properties and damage increase. Second one was similair to current behavior, but the punch damage was always 22 and it had additional upward motion. It also always triggered on the 4 th hit, rather than with sneaking.

Usage \u00b6 Prismatic Punch transforms any shot Arrow into a powerful Prismatic Blast. They are slow and deccelerate over a timespan of 20 seconds until detonating. They can also bounce off walls. Prismatic Blasts gain a huge speed bonus when an enemy is nearby, which they will target and home onto, detonating on contact. Explosions deal varying damage, between 4 and 10 damage, while also dealing a bit of splash damage to entities around. Multishot enchantment causes 3 different-colored blasts to be shot in a 50\u00b0 cone. Piercing causes blasts to sometimes create secondary explosions on other nearby entities, with the max amount of extra explosions being directly defined by the enchantment level. Additional explosions from both Multishot and Piercing enchantments deal reduced damage. Prismatic Inferno \u00b6 All explosions inflict new damage over time effect known as Prismatic Inferno, which acts as an upgraded version of Flame Enchantment, dealing twice the damage while lasting for the same duration. Prismatic Inferno lasts for 3 seconds, dealing 1 \u0445 \u2080.\u2087\u2085 damage every second. Tips \u00b6 Use regular Arrows with this weapon, since it converts ALL ammo into Blasts. Using Spectral/Tipped Arrows is a waste of ammo. Explosions can hurt you if you stand too close to your target. Keep your distance. Accuracy is not the most important thing, since Blasts will home on its targets. Be careful though, as Blasts tend to target different mobs than the ones you want! Prismatic Blasts do not home onto players in PvP, but they can still hurt them if a player happened to step into them. This also means they can hurt you if you are not careful enough! Explosions from Prismatic Punch ignore invulnerability frames. This means that: Multishot can deal much more damage if all blasts target the same mob. Different chain explosions from Piercing can damage the same mob, increasing or outright multiplying the damage if they were to be close to each other. Trivia \u00b6 This is first Developer Item to have been added into Stellarity. This is the second Crossbow to get added, first being the Clockwork Crossbow .

Its quick attack speed can be utilized to heal large portions of lost HP when attacking in a quick succesion. Trivia \u00b6 Sariel will not spawn any Healing Orbs if damage done in a single hit is lower than 3. This is in order to prevent spam clicking to heal massive amounts of HP.

Fletchers in End Villages can turn any existing Bow into Sharanga for 64 Emeralds. Usage \u00b6 Unless Spectral Arrows are used as ammunition for this Bow, it has no special properties other than increased durability. When using Spectral Arrows as ammunition, they are converted into high velocity Spectral Bolts. Spectral Bolts can pierce an infinite number of enemies, inflicting Glowing for 10 seconds, while moving at 1.2x the speed of standard Arrows. Due to how arrow damage is calculated, this also means a 1.2x damage multiplier. Spectral Bolts travel in a straight line, being completely unnaffected by gravity.

Arrows will always disappear after 1.5 seconds, not after travelling a set distance. Sharanga enchanted with Infinity is superior to one enchanted with Mending due to increased chance of conserving Spectral Arrows.

Tips \u00b6 Spirits can be attracted by ANY damage, including (but not limited to) other Swords, Crossbows, Bows, etc., for as long as you are holding a Spirit Dagger in any hand.

Teleporting has a distance limit of 70 blocks , meaning that you could potentialy attract a Spirit by shooting an enemy with a Bow and teleport a great range. Spyglass comes in handy in this scenario, since you can easily position your cursor on a Spirit and then switch to a Spirit Dagger in order to consume it. To fully use this weapon you have to obtain 2 of them. Using a weapon enchanted with Looting III is heavily encouraged due to how uncommon Phantoms are in The End. Despite the drop chance being relatively low, this item can be easily obtained in great quantities by opening multiple Pandora's Barrels . Be careful though, as Pandora's Barrel also increases stats of spawned mobs. Slash attack won't deal any knockback, so you might still get damaged by mobs after teleporting. Luckily, the 4 Absorption should be enough to tank at least part of the contact damage. This can be remedied by enchanting your Spirit Daggers with Knockback. This item pairs extremely well with Sharanga , since Arrows shot from are unaffected by gravity, meaning that it is easier to snipe targets from far away in order to potentially attract Spirits. Trivia \u00b6 This is the second Developer weapon to get added into Stellarity, the first being Prismatic Punch . This weapon is based on Spirit Daggers - a weapon used by Evelynn 1 in Roblox BedWars 2 . This is also a reference to the fact that kohara loves this game and plays it far more often than he is coding. This item had a total of 3 different drop chances prior to official release. It first started with 12.5% base chance with 2.5% Looting bonus, then 15%/+3.5% before being nerfed to 10%/+1%, which stayed to this date. Prior to official release of 2.0a, Spirits used to directly heal 4 HP instead of granting 4 Absorption like it does now. This change was made to further replicate how Evelynn kit works in Roblox Bedwars. Spirit Dagger holds the title of the most tweaked weapon before its official release in a stable version, having been tweaked countless times prior to its release in 2.0a. Some of the changes haven't even been listed on changelog Discord channel. In a development log made on January 27 th 2023, Spirits were said have a light blue glowing outline, however this wasn't actually implemented.

After sneaking for a moment, you will warp to the nearest weak mob, instantly killing them. This warp has a range of 16 blocks and will be cancelled if a mob walks out of that radius. Executing a mob holding a Totem of Undying will apply a 11 second cooldown in order to prevent saved mob from being executed a second after using a Totem.

Tips \u00b6 Tamaris is intended to be used as a support weapon. Switching to it to reapply Decay or to execute a weak enemy is the best way to use it. Tamaris prioritizes nearest weak mob while choosing a target to execute next. Keep in mind while trying to chain execute a group of weak mobs. The execute treshold is lower for certain mobs. In PvP, health percentage required to mark a player 'executable' is 20% . On bosses (Wither, Empress of Light) and Wardens, this treshold is 10% . Adding compatibility Modders can extend the stellarity:boss tag with their own boss mob IDs to set their execute treshold to 10% Boss Datapack developers can add the stellarity.boss tag to their boss entity. This does the same thing as extending the tag, but only for one particular entity. Non-living entities (Item Frames, Armor Stands, etc.) and the Ender Dragon are immune to Tamaris' execute. Try not to use this weapon in Multiplayer while teaming up with other players, as it could potentialy lead to one of your allies being accidentaly executed. Execute move targets the closest weak mob, so use it to avoid mistakes. Trivia \u00b6 The execute ability deals 999 damage with 100% armor penetration instead of doing /kill directly. This is because /kill ignores Totems of Undying. This item was intended to be called Void Star , but the official name was changed before release. It was also supposed to have a consecrated variant called Hallow Star , which would simply have different visual and sound effects. This item and its ability is based on Hannah 1 kit from Roblox BedWars 2 . Sounds used for triggering the Execute ability are actual sounds of Hannah triggering her Execute move from Roblox Bedwars. Additionally, kohara uses a different execute sound, being the one of Victorious Hannah instead. Tamaris was supposed to replace Dragonblade as its one-per-world kind of item. However due to a community vote, it became a Dragon drop instead. Its name Tamaris is a reference to kohara's grandma's cat's name - Tamara . The name Tamara is a polish name derivating from hebrew, which rougly translates into palm tree . kohara chose to base the name off the aformentioned cat because he had always seen it as a hidden assasin who is ready to scratch anyone .

This stacks up to 5 times for a grand total of 25% extra damage. This boost lasts for 5 seconds before vanishing, unless another attack has hit a mob. The set bonus extra damage stacks with the 10% extra damage from all armor pieces, meaning the actual damage increase is 35%.

Movement Speed increase was so huge that players could trigger vanilla anti-cheat in Singleplayer while wearing 2 or more armor pieces.
